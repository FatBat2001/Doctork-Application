-"Doctork Application" :

-The project idea is to detect X-rays images of chest and classify them into 3 classes (Covid-Pneumonia-Healthy).

-Detect MRI of brain and classify them to (brain with tumor - brain with no tumor).

-Detect MRI images of breast and classify them to (breast with cancer- breast with no cancer).

-We have built and trained deep learning models based on CNN and deployed these models to make a Graphical User Interface for our desktop application .

-PyQt5 Library used for GUI .
